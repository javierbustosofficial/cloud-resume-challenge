    "description": "The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project where I designed and implemented a serverless AWS-based personal website using S3 for static hosting and CloudFront as a CDN, with a visitor counter built on API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB. Infrastructure was provisioned using Terraform, with application logic written in Python and frontend components implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.",
    "body_html": "<h1>Work In Progress!</h1>\n<p>This project is still a work in progress! A full write up and video will soon fill this page. Stay tuned!</p>"
