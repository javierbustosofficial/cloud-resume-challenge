    "description": "The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project where I built and deployed my resume as a real cloud application rather than a static webpage. It showcases my ability to design, host, and secure infrastructure using AWS services while following modern cloud and DevOps best practices. The project includes a serverless backend, infrastructure as code, and automated deployments to mirror real-world cloud workflows. It serves as a practical demonstration of how I approach cloud engineering beyond certifications.",
    "body_html": "<h1>Work In Progress!</h1>\n<p>This project is still a work in progress! A full write up and video will soon fill this page. Stay tuned!</p>"
