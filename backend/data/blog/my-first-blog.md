## My Journey So Far: From IT Student to Systems Administrator

My path into IT started at **Texas State Technical College**, where I pursued an Associate of Applied Science in Cybersecurity Technology. While studying, I wasn’t just focused on theory—I wanted real-world exposure as early as possible. I was learning the fundamentals of systems, security, and networking, but I knew experience would be the real differentiator once I entered the field. That mindset pushed me to start working in IT before I had even finished school.

## Getting Started at Contigo Technology

While still enrolled, I landed my first IT role at **Contigo Technology** as a **PC Setup Technician**. This was my introduction to professional IT environments and end-user support. I spent my days configuring and deploying workstations, installing RMM tools, antivirus software, and company-specific applications, and working with Active Directory and Office 365 to set up user accounts. It was hands-on, fast-paced, and foundational—exactly what I needed early in my career.

That role quickly evolved into **Help Desk Technician I** and later **Help Desk Technician II**, where I handled a wide range of hardware, software, and networking issues. I supported users remotely and on-site, documented solutions, assisted Tier 1 technicians, and became the primary technician for a multi-location healthcare client. This period shaped how I troubleshoot problems, communicate with users, and think through issues methodically under pressure.

## Growing Into Enterprise IT at Texas Health and Human Services

After gaining solid experience in managed services, I transitioned to **Texas Health and Human Services Commission** as a **Deskside Support Technician**. This role exposed me to large-scale, enterprise environments with stricter processes, SLAs, and operational standards. I supported users across the agency, handled device deployments, managed inventory, and acted as Tier 2 support for more complex issues. Supporting everyone from frontline staff to executives sharpened both my technical and professional skills.

I later advanced into my current role as a **Systems Administrator III**, where I now work in a senior technical capacity. My responsibilities include assisting with agency-wide device refreshes, maintaining system reliability, monitoring and resolving service tickets, performing system maintenance, and supporting disaster recovery planning. This role represents a shift from purely reactive support into more systems-focused, operational responsibility.

## Where I Am Now — and Where I’m Going

Today, my focus is on continuing that progression beyond traditional IT support into cloud and infrastructure engineering. Alongside my day-to-day role, I’ve built hands-on experience with AWS services and earned multiple cloud certifications to deepen my understanding of scalable, secure systems. My long-term goal is to move into a cloud engineering or solutions architecture role, where I can design and automate infrastructure instead of just maintaining it.

This blog documents that journey—what I’ve learned, what I’m building, and how I’m intentionally moving toward higher-impact work in cloud and infrastructure.
