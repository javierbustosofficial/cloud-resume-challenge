## My Journey So Far: From IT Student to Systems Administrator

My path into IT began at **Texas State Technical College**, where I pursued an Associate of Applied Science in Cybersecurity Technology. While studying the fundamentals of hardware, security, and networking, a professor made me aware of an opportunity he thought I should consider. That conversation led to my first role in IT and marked the start of my professional experience in the field.

## Getting Started at Contigo Technology

While I was still in school, I started my first IT role at Contigo Technology as a PC Setup Technician. To be honest, when I started, I had no idea what I was doing. Learning the theory in a classroom was one thing, but applying it in a real business environment—with real clients and real consequences—was something entirely different.

The work itself wasn’t especially hard to understand, but the pressure was. Every task felt high-stakes, and I was constantly aware that a mistake could impact not just the company, but the clients we supported. The first few months were uncomfortable and challenging, but over time things began to click.

As I gained confidence, I was promoted to Help Desk Technician I and joined the main ticket queue, where I faced a new challenge: providing direct, on-demand support to clients. Through repetition and exposure, that fear slowly turned into confidence. My performance improved, and eventually I was promoted again—this time to Help Desk Technician II. In that role, I became the primary technical point of contact for one of our largest clients, a healthcare organization with 13 offices across Central Texas. Looking back, those early experiences were demanding, but they played a major role in shaping how I approach problems and responsibility today.

## Growing Into Enterprise IT at Texas Health and Human Services

When I transitioned to Texas Health and Human Services Commission as a contractor, something felt different right away. The imposter syndrome I’d felt early on at Contigo wasn’t there anymore. I carried a level of confidence I hadn’t had before, largely because of my time in managed services. Working at an MSP meant constantly adapting to new clients, environments, tools, and processes—it often felt like starting a new job every few months. Because of that, joining HHSC felt familiar, like getting to know just another client.

The scale, however, was on a completely different level. Instead of supporting a handful of organizations, I was now part of a team supporting over 10,000 staff across the state. With that scale came something I hadn’t experienced before: a large, well-structured team I could rely on, and that could rely on me. When a full-time position opened up, I didn’t hesitate to apply—even though it meant interviewing alongside colleagues I already worked with.

That role ended up being the Systems Administrator III position I hold today. It marked a clear shift into more senior, Tier 3–level work. I now handle higher-stakes issues, whether that’s major escalations, emergency situations, or supporting C-suite staff where expectations are understandably high. Beyond day-to-day support, I’m also involved in initiatives aimed at improving internal processes and testing resources—such as device images and security tools—before they’re rolled out to the broader organization. It’s been a transition from simply reacting to problems to helping shape how systems are supported at scale.

## Where I Am Now — and Where I’m Going

These days, my focus is on continuing that progression beyond traditional IT support and into cloud and infrastructure engineering. Alongside my day-to-day work, I’ve been spending time building hands-on experience with AWS and earning cloud certifications to better understand how scalable, secure systems are designed and operated.

This blog is where I document that process—what I’m learning, what I’m building, and how I’m intentionally moving toward more infrastructure-focused, higher-impact work in the cloud.
