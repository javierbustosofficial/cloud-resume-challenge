## Render Project Eumlate Markdown

For this project I want to be able to render markdown.
Through my research, I've learned that rendering markdown serverside is preferred, since clientside redendering provides inconsistent results.

The `render_projects.py` file will render our json with the markdown into html.
Eventually I'll rework this code into a Lambda function in AWS.
